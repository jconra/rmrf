// AI.js — opponent "brains". Deliberately knows nothing about THREE or the scene:
// main.js builds a fog-of-war `view` each tick (only what this unit is allowed to
// perceive) and applies the returned intentions. That keeps the AI honest — it
// can't read the player's position unless it actually sees the player or stumbles
// on a freshly damaged wall.
//
// Each brain has a randomised PERSONALITY (aggression / defensiveness / wanderlust
// / a preferred vehicle / reaction jitter) so no two opponents play the same, and
// a little stochastic noise on top so they stay unpredictable.
//
// DATA-DRIVEN DECISION GRAPH: the tactical logic is split into three parts so it
// can be inspected and edited as a flowchart (and round-tripped through an external
// editor) without touching this file:
//   * CONDITIONS — named predicates over the `view` + latched memory.
//   * BEHAVIORS  — named steering routines that produce {fwd,turn,fire}. The trig
//                  lives here; the graph only chooses WHICH one runs and WHEN.
//   * DEFAULT_BRAIN — the graph itself: config knobs, latched interrupts, and an
//                  ordered transition table. `runBrain(graph, view, mem)` walks it.
// `Brain.think()` is now a thin wrapper around runBrain(DEFAULT_BRAIN, …); assign a
// different graph to a brain's `.graph` to change its behavior.
